# Root finding algorithm service

This is a web app for finding root using 3 different algorithm
1. Bisection
2. Fixed point
3. Newton's method

## Features
- User can input `f(x)` and `range` to find a root
- User can select **numbers of iterations**

## Output
- 3 different graphs (Bisection, Fixed point, Newton's method)
- Graph of `error` and `numbers of iterations`
