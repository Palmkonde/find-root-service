# Root finding algorithm service

This is a web app for finding root using 2 different algorithm
1. Bisection
3. Newton's method

## Features
- User can input `f(x)` and `range` to find a root
- User can select **numbers of iterations**

## Output
- 2 different graphs (Bisection, Fixed point, Newton's method)
- Graph of `error` and `numbers of iterations`

## Requirement
- Make a folder name ./static/image and ./tmp_image first!
- `pip install -r requirement.txt`
